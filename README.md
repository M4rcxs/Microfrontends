# Microfrontends Project

Welcome to the Microfrontends Project! This repository contains the most popular, complete, and up-to-date resource online for learning how to use microfrontends.

Thousands of engineers have successfully implemented microfrontends using this project, and you can too. This repository follows a time-tested, battle-proven approach to ensure you understand exactly how microfrontends work. It aims to help you land a job as a software engineer or build the app you've always dreamed about.

## Key Features

Microfrontends divide a large app into a series of smaller apps, providing unique benefits:

- **Smaller, Easier Codebases**: Author smaller, more manageable codebases.
- **Library Flexibility**: Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app, bringing the best tool for the job.
- **Separate Deployment**: Deploy each portion separately, minimizing the risk of user interruption.
- **Independent Teams**: Allow each engineering team to work independently.

## Why This Project?

Microfrontends architecture is gaining popularity, but misinformation is common. This project has been developed with input from top engineers to ensure technical accuracy. Additionally, it helps you evaluate whether microfrontends are a good choice for your application.

## Project Structure

This project features numerous modules and diagrams to help you understand how microfrontends work. Through detailed explanations and practical examples, you'll learn the fundamentals of building dynamic web apps using microfrontends.

Each module is added incrementally to ensure a solid foundation of knowledge. Discussions included in each module help you understand when and where to use each aspect of microfrontends.

## Topics Covered

Below is a partial list of the topics covered in this project:

- **Design Patterns**: Learn design patterns used by the largest companies.
- **When to Use Microfrontends**: Understand the appropriate use cases for microfrontends.
- **Tiered Routing System**: Link multiple apps together using a tiered routing system.
- **CSS Scoping**: Scope CSS to prevent cross-app contamination.
